1. The foundation
    * building a `HelloWorld` contract.
    * testing it
    * deploying it
    * comunicating from the browser

2. Understanding solidity
    * a slightly more complex contract with reading and writing
    * on Rinkeby [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

3. Complex contract
    * the concepts
        * arrays
        * mappings
        * bits
            * what does this mean?
                * `a & b == b`
                * `(0x1 <<3) - 1`
        * testing, deploying, communicating
